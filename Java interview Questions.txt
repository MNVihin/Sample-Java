*Iterator vs listierator:
--------------------------------


Iterator:
Scope: General-purpose iterator for all Collection types, including List, Set, and Queue.
Traversal: Unidirectional (forward only) using hasNext() and next().
Modification: Supports removal of the last element returned by next() using remove(). It does not support adding or modifying elements directly.


ListIterator:
Scope: Specific to List implementations (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).
Traversal: Bidirectional (forward and backward) using hasNext(), next(), hasPrevious(), and previous().

Modification: Supports removal of the last element returned by next() or previous() using remove(). Additionally, it allows modification of the last element returned using set(E e) and insertion of new elements at the current cursor position using add(E e).


*Comparable 
-----------------
Natural order sorting

It is used for a single sorting order.



vs comparator interface:
--------------------------

Custom order sorting

It is used for multiple sorting orders.
